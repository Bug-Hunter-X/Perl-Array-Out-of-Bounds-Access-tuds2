This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl: accessing an element in an array beyond its defined bounds. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to access an index that does not exist within the array. This can result in undefined behavior, runtime errors, or unexpected values. The solution involves adding checks to ensure the index is within the valid range of the array.
